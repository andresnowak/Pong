    This is the classic game of pong where two players on opposite sides of each other try to hit the ball to\ the other side to score a point. If the ball reaches the other side and the opponent cannot hit it back,\ you score a point. The game resets when one player reaches 11 points.

#### Controls:
    The controls for the left player are 'w' for upward motion and 's' for downward motion.\
    The controls for the right player are 'up arrow' for upward motion and 'down arrow' for downward motion.\
